Welcome to the EasyPaint app! (CS349 A2)

To get started, the main file (with the main method) is EasyPaint.java.

You can use gradle clean, gradle build, gradle run on this project

AppScreen is the main JPanel for the whole EasyPaint application, and the sub panels are divided
into its respective classes within the Main.Screens folder. Each drawn shape on the screen is also
an object, and each of the objects are defined in its respective class in Main.CanvasShapes.

To load files, sample image .ezp (Easy Paint files) are located in the 'image files' folder, within the 
same level as src, readme, and build. You can save your images in another folder but the sample 
images will always be under image files!
